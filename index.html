            <h2 id=aboutme>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Baylee Giovanna Diaso, I was born on August 17th, 1999. I was born in Fresno California. My favorite hobbies are gaming on my computer and drawing. I have 2 older brothers, one is moved out and married and one still lives with us.</p> 
                <p>My dream vacation would to go to beach and go to amusement parks like Disney world with my best friends and boyfriend. Someday I would like to visit Japan because Japanese food is my favorite kind of food and love their anime stuff.</p>

                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>When I get older I want to go to college and get a job as a graphic designer or start a business. I’m not sure what college or what business I want yet but I have a lot of time to think about it.</p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>Before the school year ends I want to have all A’s and B’s on my report card and be less shy. My grades right now are pretty close but I need to work a little harder. I wanna be less shy because I have a hard time talking to people and I’m terrified when it comes to presenting in front of people.</p>
